    <h1>Virtualization</h1>

    <p>
      In computing.<b>Virtualization</b> refers to the act of creating a virtual <i>(rather than actual)</i> version of something.
      This includes virtual computer hardware ;virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.
    </p>

    <h1>levels of Virtualization</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) level </b>
      Every machine has an instruction set. this instruction set is an interface between software and hardware. using this instructions software can <br> communicate with hardware.
      <li>
        <b>Virtualization at operating system (o.s) level</b>
      </li>
      <p>
        In Virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S.; aplication suites; networking systems,etc.
       </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In cloud sometimes; we need to initialize 100 virtual machine at a single time; if we use Virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer <br> (HAL) level this can take too much time.
      </li>
       <li>
         So,to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between virtual machine along with the Hardware.
       </li>
    </ul>
    </ol>
